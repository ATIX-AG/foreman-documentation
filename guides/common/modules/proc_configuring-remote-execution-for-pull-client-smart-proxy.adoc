= Configuring remote execution for pull client

By default, Remote Execution uses SSH as the transport mechanism for the Script provider.
However, Remote Execution also offers pull-based transport, which you can use if your infrastructure prohibits outgoing connections from {target} to hosts.

The mode is configured per {SmartProxy}.
Some {SmartProxies} can be configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode while others use SSH.
If this is the case, it is possible that one remote job on a given host will use the pull client and the next job on the same host will use SSH.
If you wish to avoid this scenario, configure all {SmartProxies} to use the same mode.

In `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts subscribe for job notifications to either your {ProjectServer} or any {SmartProxyServer} through which they are registered.
Therefore, it is recommended to ensure that {ProjectServer} sends remote execution jobs to that same {SmartProxy}.
This comprises `pull-mqtt` mode on {SmartProxy} in combination with a pull client running on hosts.

[NOTE]
====
The `pull-mqtt` mode works only with the Script provider.
Ansible and other providers will continue to use their default transport settings.

.Procedure
. Enable the pull-based transport on your {target}:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
ifeval::["{target}" == "{ProjectServer}"]
# {installer-scenario} \
endif::[]
ifeval::["{target}" == "{SmartProxyServer}"]
# {installer-scenario-smartproxy} \
endif::[]
--foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode pull-mqtt
----
. Configure the firewall to allow MQTT service:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
# firewall-cmd --add-service=mqtt
----

. In the {ProjectWebUI}, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings*.
. On the *Content* tab, set the value of *Prefer registered through {SmartProxy} for remote execution* to *Yes*.
. After enabeling pull-based transport on {target}, you must also configure it on each host.
