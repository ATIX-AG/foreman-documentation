=== Prerequisites for Container Provisioning

Before you can provision a container using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, you must have a source for images, such as a container registry.

Red Hat Satellite 6 uses three sources of container images:

* Synchronized Docker-formatted container images that are a part of the Satellite Server's application life cycle.
* Public images from Docker Hub.
* Other External registries, including Red Hat's container image registry. This is explored in xref:Provisioning_Containers-Adding_External_Registries_to_the_Satellite_Server[].
