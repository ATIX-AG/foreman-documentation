[[Provisioning_Containers]]
== Provisioning Containers

With Red Hat Satellite 6, you can create an on-premise registry, import images from various sources and distribute them to containers using Content Views. Satellite Server supports creating one or more Docker compute resources that act as servers for running containers. 

You can import an image, start a container based on this image, monitor the container's activity, and commit its state to a new image layer that can be further propagated.

For information about containers, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/7/getting-started-with-containers/getting-started-with-containers[Getting Started with Containers] guide for _Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7_.

Use this chapter to import container images and use these images to create containers.
