. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the registry.
. In the *URL* field, enter the location of the registry. For example: `https://registry.access.redhat.com`.
. Optional: In the *Description* field, enter a description for your registry entry.
. In the *Username* field, enter the user name that corresponds with your user account on the registry.
. In the *Password* field, enter the password for your user account on your registry.
. Select the *Locations* tab, and select a location.
. Select the *Organizations* tab, and select an organization.
. Click *Submit* to save the external registry.

.For CLI Users
