=== Starting, Committing, and Removing Containers


.Starting or Stopping a Container

When you create a container, its default state is disabled. By enabling a container, you start the processes of the containerized application in the compute resource. Hosts are then able to communicate with the container as with a web application.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Containers* > *All Containers*.
. From the list of existing containers, select the container that you want, and then click *Power On*. To stop the container, click *Power Off*.

.Committing a Container

When you launch a container from an image, a writable layer is added on top of this image. Committing a container creates an image layer that stores the status of that container.  Every time you commit a container a new image layer is added to store your changes.  The container is committed to the repository of the original image. For example, if the container is based on an image pulled from the Docker Hub, the committed changes are pushed back to the Docker Hub.

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Containers* > *All Containers*.
. From the list of existing containers, select the container that you want, and then click *Commit*.
. Enter a repository name, for example `user/my-rhel-image`.
. Assign a tag to the image.
. Enter your contact information.
. Enter an informative comment about the commit.
. Click *Submit*.

.Removing a Container

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Containers* > *All Containers*.
. From the list of existing containers, select the container that you want, and then click *Delete*.
. In the alert window, click *OK* to confirm the deletion.
