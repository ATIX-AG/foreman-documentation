=== Managing Container Registry Authentication

By default, users must authenticate to access containers in the Satellite image registry. Use the `docker login` command to log on to Satellite. You can then use the `docker pull` and `docker search` commands to access containers based on your Satellite permissions.

You can specify whether you want users to authenticate to access container images in a Satellite image registry that you manage in a lifecycle environment. For example, you might want to permit users to pull container images from the `Production` lifecycle without any authentication requirement and restrict access the `Development` and `QA` environments to authenticated users.

.Procedure

To manage the authentication settings for your Satellite image registry, complete the following steps:

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Content* > *Lifecycle Environments* and select the lifecycle environment that you want to manage authentication for.
. To permit unauthenticated access to the containers in this lifecycle environment, select the *Unauthenticated Pull* check box. To restrict unauthenticated access, clear the *Unauthenticated Pull* check box.
. Click *Save*.
