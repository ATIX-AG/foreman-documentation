=== Creating a Container

Use this procedure to create a container in Satellite. The Satellite web UI contains a wizard that guides you through the creation process. You can select a container image from a Content View, a Docker Hub, or an external registry that you add to Satellite.

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Containers* > *Create Container*.
. From the *Deploy on* list, select the compute resource that you want to use.
. Select the *Locations* tab, and select a location.
. Select the *Organizations* tab, and select an organization.
. Click *Next step*.

To create a container, you have three options:

* Create from a container image in Content View
* Create from an container image in the Docker Hub
* Create from an container image in an external registry.

.Creating a Container from a Content View

. From the *Lifecycle Environment* list, select the lifecycle environment that you want to use.
. From the *Content View* list, select the container image that you want to use.
. From the *Registry* list, select the registry that you want to use.
. From the *Tag* list, select the container image tag that you want to use.
. From the *Capsule* list, select the Capsule that you want to use.
. Click *Next Step*.

.Creating a Container from Docker Hub


. Select the *Docker Hub* tab, and in the *Search* field, enter the Docker container that you want to use.
. In the *Tag* field, enter the name of the container image tag that you want to use, and click *Search for images*.
. Select the container image that you want to use, and click *Next Step*.

.Creating a Container from an External Registry

. From the *Registry* list, select a registry that you want to use.
. In the *Search* field, enter the name of the container image that you want to use.
. In the *Tag* field, enter the tag that is associated with the container image you want to use.
. Click *Search for images* and select the image that you want to use, and click *Next step*.

.Finishing the Container Creation Process
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the new container.
. In the *Command* field, enter a command that you want to run in the container.
. In the *Entry point* field, enter a command that you want the container to execute automatically when the container starts. The default entrypoint is `/bin/sh -c`.
. Select the *Compute options* tab.
. In the *CPU Sets* field, assign CPUs to the container. For example, 0-2,16 represents CPUs 0, 1, 2, and 16.
. In the *CPU share* field, assign the CPU share for the container. This sets the share of CPU time available to containerized tasks.
. In the *Memory* field, enter the memory size that you want to allocate to the container.
. Click *Next Step*.
. In the *Environment variables* field, define a set of environmental variables. For example, `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`.
. In the *Exposed Ports* field, enter the number of ports that you want to open in the container. For example, you can open SSH communication to the container on port 22.
. In the *DNS* field, enter the DNS server for the container.
. Select the *Run* check box to start the container automatically after it is created.
. Click *Submit* to create a container.

.For CLI Users

The following are three examples of the `hammer docker container create` command.

* To create a container from a Content View:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer docker container create --compute-resource "Atomic" \
--repository-name "rhel7" --tag "latest" --name "docker-test1" \
--command "bash" --organizations "_My_Organization_" --locations "New York"
----

* To provision from the Docker Hub:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer docker container create --compute-resource "Atomic" \
--repository-name "docker.io/redhat" --tag latest \
--name "docker-test2" --command bash --organizations "_My_Organization_" \
--locations "New York"
----

* To provision from an external registry:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# hammer docker container create --compute-resource "Atomic" \
--registry-id 1 --repository-name "rhel" --tag latest \
--name "docker-test3 --command bash --organizations "_My_Organization_" \
--locations "New York"
----
